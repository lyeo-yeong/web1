 <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/" target="_black" title="w3c">W3C</a> is accepting proposals
    from outside vendors to redesign the existing W3C website.
     Our organization, which celebrate
     d its 25th anniversary this year, produces open and royalty-free Web Standards and guidelines that make the Web work, for everyone.
 We believe that by implementing current web best practices and technologies, revising the information architecture, creating a content strategy and revamping the visual design, we can provide our audiences with the best information in a more user-friendly fashion, motivate participation in the organization, and communicate the nature and impact of the W3C more effectively.

 The current website was redesigned in 2008, moving to a responsive layout, a revised architecture and a custom CMS. Now over 10 years old, the website is showing its age and we have determined that it is not as effective in supporting the W3C’s mission and goals as it could be.
